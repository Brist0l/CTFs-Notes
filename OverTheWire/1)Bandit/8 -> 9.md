output of `cat data.txt`

I did this cuz the level said that the password is in the file.

Next we need the line which hasn't been repeated. For that we can use
`uniq` but this tool requires the repeated stuff to be one after the 
other(in the next line also works). So we just pipe this `cat` output
to `sort` and pipe it again to `uniq -u`. We are using the `-u` option so
that we get only the non repeated sentence and not every repeated 
sentence printed once.
